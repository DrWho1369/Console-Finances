**Console Finances**

**Project Description**

   The Console Finances project is designed to analyze the financial records of a company using JavaScript. The primary goal is to calculate key financial metrics based on a provided dataset, including the total number of months, net total profit/losses, average change in profit/losses, greatest increase, and greatest decrease in profit/losses over the entire period.

   This project serves as a real-world application of JavaScript skills, requiring the implementation of logic to navigate and analyze financial data efficiently.

**How to Install and Run the Project**

   To run the Console Finances project locally, follow these steps:

   - Open the deployed website link
   - Click on the button for the financial calculation you wish to perform
   - Display or hide the dataset as you choose fit
   
**How to Use the Project**

   Once the project is running, the website will display the financial analysis, including:
   - Total number of months
   - Net total profit/losses
   - Average change in profit/losses
   - Greatest increase in profits/losses (date and difference)
   - Greatest decrease in profits/losses (date and difference)

   Ensure that you review the dataset output by clicking the display data button for the detailed financials.
